## Overview

Guild performs hyperparameter optimization by running trials in a [*batch*](/docs/runs#batches). A batch is a Guild operation that specializes in running trials. Each type of batch operation generates trials in a different way.

The batch operation is specified for a run using the `--optimizer` option with [`guild run`](/commands/run). The default optimizer is implicitly specified with `--optimize`.

As with any Guild operation, you can view help for a batch operation using `--help-op` with [`guild run`](/commands/run).

``` command
guild run gp --help-op
```

The following table lists built-in batch operations. Define your own batch operation and use it the same way.

| *Operation Name* | *Description* |
|-|-|
| [+](/docs/runs#default-batch-operation) | Generate a trial for each unique set of specified flag values |
| [random](/reference/optimizers#random) | Generate trials with flag values selected from specified distributions |
| [gp](/reference/optimizers#gp) | Sequential Bayesian optimization using Gaussian processes |
| [forest](/reference/optimizers#forest) | Sequential Bayesian optimization using decision trees |
| [gbrt](/reference/optimizers#gbrt) | Sequential Bayesian optimization using gradient boosted regression trees |

## Grid Search

Grid search is performed by Guild's default batch operation. Perform a grid search to explore a predetermined set of hyperparameters.

The default batch operation is invoked implicitly when any flag value is a list and no other optimizer takes precedence. Another optimizer takes precedence it specified with `--optimize` or `--optimizer` or if any flag value is a [*search space function*](/docs/flags#search-space-functions).

The following command generates *sixteen* trials, one for each combination of the specified values:

``` command
guild run train lr='[0.0001,0.001,0.01,0.1]' dropout='[0.1,0.2,0.3,0.4]'
```

You can use use [*sequential flag functions*](/docs/flags#sequence-functions) to generate value lists. The following is equivalent to the previous command:

``` command
guild run train lr='logspace[-4:-1:4]' dropout=range[0.1:0.4:0.1]
```

### Grid Search and Search Functions

By default, Guild uses the `random` optimizer when a flag value is a [search space function](/docs/flags#search-space-functions). For example, this command implicitly uses the `random` optimizer because it uses the `loguniform` search space function for *`lr`*:

``` command
guild run train lr=loguniform[1e-4:1e-2] dropout=[0.1,0.2]
```

This command generates 20 trials. It selects values for *`dropout`* at random from the two choices `0.1` and `0.2`.

To run a grid search in this case, specify the optimizer as `+`:

``` command
guild run train lr=loguniform[1e-4:1e-2] dropout=[0.1,0.2] --optimizer +
```

By specifing `--optimizer` you override Guild's default behavior. This command generates two runs --- one for each value of *`dropout`*. It selects random values for *`lr`* from the specified distribution.

## Random Search

Random search is performed by the `random` optimizer. The random optimizer is used implicitly if any flag uses a [*search space function*](/docs/flags#search-space-functions).

By default the random optimizer generates 20 trials. Change this by specifying the `--max-trials` option with [`guild run`](/commands/run).

The following command uses the random optimizer to run 10 trials. It selects values for *`lr`* at random from the log-uniform distribution over the range `1e-4` to `1e-1`:

``` command
guild run train lr=loguniform[1e-4:1e-1] --max-trials 10
```

If you specify a list value, `random` selects values from the list at random from a uniform distribution. See [Grid Search and Search Functions](#grid-search-and-search-functions) above if you want to use grid search with search space functions.

Explicitly use `random` by specifying `--optimizer` (or the short form `-o`) with [`guild run`](/commands/run):

``` command
guild run train lr=logspace[-4:-1:4] dropout=range[0.1:0.4:0.1] -Fo random -m 10
```

In this case, the random optimizer runs 10 trials, selecting values at random from the choices.

## Sequential Optimization

Sequential optimization is performed by a batch operation that use previous trials to suggest hyperparameter values it believes will yield a better result (e.g. lower loss, higher accuracy, etc. Sequential optimizers include [`gp`](/reference/optimizers#gp), [`forest`](/reference/optimizers#forest), and [`gbrt`](/reference/optimizers#gbrt).

Flag values do not implicitly select sequential optimizers. You must explicitly select an optimizer by specifying `--optimize` or `--optimizer` with [`guild run`](/commands/run).

Use `-Fo` options to set optimizer flags for a batch. The following command sets *`xi`* and *`random-starts`* for the `gp` optimizer:

``` command
guild run train -o gp -Fo xi=0.1 -Fo random-starts=5
```

By deault, sequential optimizers attempts to minimize the `loss` scalar value. Use `--maximize` or `--minimize` with the [`run`](command:run) command to specify a different scalar. For example, to maximize the scalar `auc` with the `forest` optimizer, use:

``` command
guild run train -o forest --maximize auc
```

If your operation does not log the specified scalar (or `loss` if the default is used), Guild falls back to use randomly selected values for variable flags. In this case, Guild shows the message `INFO: [guild] Random start for optimization (cannot find objective '<scalar>')`.

## Custom Optimizers

You can use any operation as an optimizer. See [*Hyperopt Example*](/examples/hyperopt) for a custom optimizer.
