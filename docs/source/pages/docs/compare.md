## Overview

Guild Compare is a [curses based application](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curses_(programming_library)) that you run from the command line. It's convenient both for local and remote comparisons as it works equally well over ssh.

Use Guild Compare to view runs in a spreadsheet format including flags and scalar values.

## Start Guild Compare

To start Guild Compare, run:

``` command
guild compare
```

This shows all available runs. You can limit the runs using filters like operation, status, and start time. For a list of filters, see [`guild compare`](/commands/compare).

## Interactive Mode

By default, Guild Compare runs in *interactive mode*. It runs as an application that lets you explore runs using key commands.

For a list of supported key commands, press **?** when running in interactive mode.

Below are common actions you perform in interactive mode.

| | |
|-|-|
| *Navigate* | Use the arrow keys to move the active cell to different rows and columns. |
| *Sort runs by a column* | Use the arrow keys to navigate to the column you want to sort by. Press **1** to sort in ascending order or **2** for descending. |
| *Refresh the display with the latest information* | Press **r** (for refresh) at any point to show the latest information. Guild does not automatically update the display. |
| *View run details* | Press **Enter** to view details for a selected run. Press **q** to exit the detail window. |

## Export Data

You can use Guild Compare to generate a CSV file with run data.

To export data to a CSV file, use the `--csv` option.

``` command
guild compare --csv runs.csv
```

<span data-guild-class="caption">Writes runs compare data to `runs.csv`</span>

To print the CSV contents to the console, use `-` for the file name:

``` command
guild compare --csv -
```

<span data-guild-class="caption">Prints runs compare data to the console</span>

## Compare Tools

Guild supports *tool extensions* that let you compare runs using different tools.

To compare runs using a tool extension, use the `--tool` option with the tool name.

For example, to compare runs using HiPlot, run:

``` command
guild compare --tool hiplot
```

Supported tools:

<div data-guild-class="terms">

Refer to the sections below for detail on each tool.

### HiPlot

HiPlot is a visualization tool developed by Facebook used to discover correlations and patterns in high-dimensional data. It has a high performance parallel plots graphing engine that can be used as an alternative to TensorBoard's HParams plugin.

To use HiPlot with Guild Compare, first install the HiPlot Python library:

``` command
pip install hiplot
```

Verify that the `hiplot-render` program is installed:

``` command
hiplot-render --help
```

If you get an error, confirm that HiPlot is installed correctly. Refer to [Installing HiPlot](https://facebookresearch.github.io/hiplot/getting_started.html#installing) for help.

To use HiPlot with Guild Compare, run:

``` command
guild compare --tool hiplot
```

Use the `HIPLOT_RENDER` environment variable to specify an alternative location to the `hiplot-render` program. This is useful when running HiPlot from a location that isn't on your system path.
