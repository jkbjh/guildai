## Overview

A *Guild environment* is a system runtime used to manage runs. All Guild commands are executed in the context of a Guild environment.

View information about the current environment using [`guild check`](/commands/check).

The `guild_home` attribute in `check` output indicates the location of the Guild environment. By default the Guild environment is `~/.guild` where `~` is the active user home directory. For more information, see [Guild Home](#guild-home) below.

## Virtual Environments

By default, Guild environments correspond to activated virtual environments. Use virtual environments created using [conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/) or [`virtualenv`](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) to isolate your work, including Guild runs.

Virtual environment let you run Python operations using a specific Python runtime along with a controlled set of installed libraries. When you activate a virtual environment, Guild operations run within this isolated context.

By default, runs are stored within the virtual environment. This lets you isolate your project work per environment. You can change this behavior so that runs are stored in a different location by [changing the location of Guild home](#set-guild-home).

> <span data-guild-class="callout important">Important</span> Take care when deleting virtual environments as they may contain Guild runs. Look for `.guild/runs` within the virtual environment directory to verify that you aren't accidentally deleting runs.

## Guild Home

*Guild home* is a directory that contains Guild-maintained files. These include:

- Runs
- Cached downloaded resources
- Cached run output scalars
- Remote state
- Deleted runs
- Interprocess locks

Guild Home is laid out as follows:

|||
|-|-|
| <span data-guild-class="ls-dir-open">Guild Home Directory</span> | <span data-guild-class="dim">default is `~/.guild` or `<venv>/.guild` within a virtual env </span> |
| <span data-guild-class="ls-dir-open ls-1">cache</span> | <span data-guild-class="dim">Guild-maintained caches</span> |
| <span data-guild-class="ls-dir ls-2">import-flags</span> | <span data-guild-class="dim">cached flags imported from scripts</span> |
| <span data-guild-class="ls-dir ls-2">resources</span> | <span data-guild-class="dim">cached resources</span> |
| <span data-guild-class="ls-dir ls-2">runs</span> | <span data-guild-class="dim">indexed run scalars</span> |

| <span data-guild-class="ls-dir ls-2">runs</span> | <span data-guild-class="dim">deleted runs</span> |

> <span data-guild-class="callout tip">Tip</span> Use [`guild check`](/commands/check) to show the current Guild home. This is the value shown for `guild_home` in the output.

### Set Guild Home

By default, Guild resolves Guild home by first looking in the activated virtual environment. If an environment isn't activated, Guild uses `.guild` in the current user's home directory.

You can specify a different location for Guild home using one of two methods:

- Set `GUILD_HOME` environment variable
- Use `-H` when running a Guild command

To set `GUILD_HOME` for all Guild commands in a command shell, run:

``` command
export GUILD_HOME=<path>
```

To set Guild home for one command, use one of these methods:

``` command
GUILD_HOME=<path> guild <command> ...
```

or:

``` command
guild -H <path> <command> ...
```

> <span data-guild-class="callout note">Note</span> When using `-H`, the option must be specified *before* `<command>`.

For help setting environment variables on Windows, see [Help with Windows](/docs/windows).

## Create a Guild Environment

New environments may be created using the following methods:

- Use [`guild init`](/commands/init)
- Use one of the standard Python tools: [`virtualenv`](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/), [`venv`](https://docs.python.org/library/venv.html), or [conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/)
- Create a new directory and [set it as Guild home](#set-guild-home)

[`guild init`](/commands/init) command uses `virtualenv` to create a new virtual environment. When running `init`, Guild performs additional steps to streamline the process of creating a virtualized Guild environment for a project:

- Uses a Python [dependency specification](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0508/) to select an appropriate Python version when creating the virtual environment
- Runs `pip install -r requirements.txt` if `requirements.txt` is defined for a project

## Activate Virtual Environments

You must activate a virtual environment before using it. Activate a virtual environment using the applicable method.

To activate an environment created with [`guild init`](/commands/init) run:

``` command
source guild-env [<env path>]
```

<span data-guild-class="caption">Activate a virtual environment created using [`guild init`](/commands/init)</span>

You may omit `<env path>` if the environment is defined in the current directory or in a `venv` subdirectory.

> <span data-guild-class="callout note">Note</span> Virtual environments created using [`guild init`](/commands/init) are standard Python virtual environments and can be activated by sourcing the `bin/activate` environment. The `guild-env` command provides a convenient alternative.

To activate an environment created using `virtualenv` or `venv` use:

``` command
source <env path>/bin/activate
```

<span data-guild-class="caption">Activate a virtual environment created using `virtualenv` or `venv`</span>

To activate a Conda environment use:

``` command
conda activate <env name>
```

For more information about Conda environments, see [Conda - Managing environments](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html).

Once activated, you can verify that Guild home is the expected environment by running:

``` command
guild check
```

Confirm that the `guild_home` attribute reflects the correct directory.
