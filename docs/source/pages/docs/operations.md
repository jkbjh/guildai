## Overview

Guild uses operations to start [*runs*](/docs/runs). Specify an operation for [`guild run`](/commands/run) using the format:

``` command
guild run OPERATION
```

Operations are defined in [Guild files](/docs/guildfiles).

Operations are defined using one of two formats:

- [Operation only](/reference/guildfile#operation-only-format)
- [Full format](/reference/guildfile#full-format)

*Operation only format* defines operations at the top-level of a Guild file, as mapping items.

``` yaml
train:
  description: Train a model

validate:
  description: Validate a model
```

<span data-guild-class="caption">Two operations defined using *operation only* format</span>

*Full format* defines operations under *models*. Models are defined in the Guild file as top-level list items, or *objects*.

``` yaml
- model: mnist
  operations:
    train:
      description: Train model on MNIST

    validate:
      description: Validate model on MNIST
```

Refer to [*Guild File Reference*](/reference/guildfile#guild-file-format) for more information on file format.

List available operations for a project using [`guild operations`](/commands/operations):

``` command
guild operations
```

> <span data-guild-class="callout tip">Tip</span> The [`guild ops`](/commands/ops) command is a shortened alias for `operations`.</span>

Guild shows the public operations defined in the project Guild file.

## Python Based Operations

Python based operations are defined in `*.py` files and must be specified using their *module name* as the `main` operation attribute in a Guild file.

``` yaml
train:
  main: train_logreg
```

<span data-guild-class="caption">Guild file (`guild.yml`) defining operation `train`, which is implemented in Python module `train_logreg`</span>

> <span data-guild-class="callout note">Note</span> Do not include the `.py` suffix when specifying `main`. The value refers to the module name, not the file name.

Guild loads such modules as `__main__` in the same way that Python itself loads them when run using `python -m <module name>` from the command line.

You may perform operation tasks directly in the module like this:

``` python
from models import logreg

logreg.train("data.csv")
```

<span data-guild-class="caption">Sample Python module --- always executes task when loaded</span>

Alternatively, check the module name and only perform operation tasks if it `__main__`.

``` python
from models import logref

def main():
    logreg.train("data.csv")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

<span data-guild-class="caption">Sample Python module --- execute task only when module is loaded as `__main__`</span>

### Additional arguments to `main`

By default, Guild passes additional arguments to the `main` module that correspond to operation [flag values](/docs/flags). You can, however, specify arguments in the `main` attribute. These additional arguments are provided regardless of the flag-specific arguments.

For example, the following `main` spec runs the Python module `logreg` with the additional argument `--train`.

``` yaml
train:
  main: logreg --train
```

### Using additional arguments for sub-commands

Python CLIs that use *sub-commands* for operations are supported using additional arguments in the `main` spec. For example, consider a script that supports `train` and `test` subcommands. You can define a `train` operation that runs the `train` command this way:

``` yaml
train:
  main: logreg train
```

## Other Language Operations

Guild supports non-Python based operations with the `exec` operation attribute. Use `exec` to specify a command that Guild runs, which can use any executable program.

For example, the following operation uses R to train a model:

``` yaml
train:
  exec: Rscript .guild/sourcecode/train.r
```

The script `train.r` is prefixed with `.guild/sourcecode/` because operations run in the context of a [*run directory*](/docs/runs#run-dir), not the project directory. Guild copies source code files from the project to the run directory under `.guild/sourcecode` by default. See [Operation Source Code](#operation-source-code) for more information.

### Flags Interface

When using non-Python languages to implement an operation, you can access flags using one of two methods:

- Command line arguments
- Environment variables

#### Flag Value Command Line Arguments

To use command line arguments, you must specify flag arguments in the `exec` specification. You can specify flag values in one of two ways:

- Individual flag references
- All flag assignments

To include a flag value in the `exec` command, use the format `${FLAG_NAME}`.

``` yaml
train:
  exec: .guild/sourcecode/train.sh ${learning-rate} ${batch-size}
  flags:
    learning-rate: 0.1
    batch-size: 100
```

When run using default flag values, Guild will start this operation using the following command:

``` command
train.sh 0.1 100
```

> <span data-guild-class="callout tip">Tip</span> Use the `--print-cmd` option with [`guild run`](/commands/run) to show the command Guild uses to start an operation.

#### Flag  Environment Variables

Guild always provides flag values as environment variables, regardless of language type. Environment variables provide a convenient way to access flags as they don't require command line processing.

### Special Command Line Arguments

Guild supports some built-in command line arguments that are replaced with special values creating the operation command.

|||
|-|-|
| `${flag_args}` | Set of flag assignments in the format `<name>=<value>` |
| `${project_dir}` | Project directory path (also available as the `PROJECT_DIR` environment variable for the operation --- see below) |

### Special Environment Variables

Guild sets a number of environment that are available for an operation.

|               |                                                                                       |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `RUN_DIR`     | Path of the active run directory                                                      |
| `RUN_ID`      | ID of the active run                                                                  |
| `PROJECT_DIR` | Path of the active run source project (e.g. where the defining Guild file is located) |
| `GUILD_OP`    | Active run op spec                                                                    |
| `GUILD_HOME`  | Path where Guild AI is installed                                                      |
| `CMD_DIR`     | Path where the Guild command was run                                                  |

## Operation Source Code

Guild saves source code for an operation with each run. This ensures that the run has a record of the source code used and that changes to project code don't affect runs in progress.

By default, Guild copies text files within the project directory as source code. As a safe-guard, Guild skips files larger than 1M and will not copy more than 100 files. Configures these rules using the `sourcecode` operation attribute.

See [*Guild File Reference*](/reference/guildfile#source-code) for information on configuring rules for source code copies.

See [*Guild File Cheatsheet*](/cheatsheets/guildfile#source-code) for examples.

By default, source code is copied to the run directory under `.guild/sourcecode`. You can change this location using the `dest` attribute of the source code spec.
