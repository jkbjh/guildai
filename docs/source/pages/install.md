## Requirements

Guild AI has the following requirements:

- macOS, Linux, Windows (Windows requires Python 3)
- Python 2.7, Python 3
- [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/) or [conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/)

For a complete list of supported platforms, see [*System Requirements*](/system-requirements#supported-operating-systems).

## Install Guild AI

### Using pip

To install Guild AI, run the following command:

``` command
pip install --user guildai
```

If you want to install Guild at the system level, omit the `--user` option and run the command as an administrator:

``` command
sudo pip install guildai
```

If you want the latest pre-release version of Guild AI, use the `--pre` option:

``` command
pip install --user guildai
```

### Using conda

If you're using conda, activate your environment:

``` command
conda activate ENV-NAME
```

Next, install Guild using `pip`:

``` command
pip install guildai
```

### With Docker

> <span data-guild-class="callout note">Note</span> Installing Guild with Docker requires that you have Docker installed. Refer to [About Docker CE](https://docs.docker.com/install/) for instructions for your platform.

Guild AI provides a Docker image that you can install by running:

``` command
docker pull guildai/guildai
```

Start an interactive TTY session using the image by running:

``` command
docker run -it guildai
```

From within the container, you can execute Guild commands.

### From Source Code

> <span data-guild-class="callout note">Note</span> This step is an alternative to installing Guild AI with pip described above. Install Guild AI from source code if you want a specific version from GitHub (e.g. an early release or development branch) or if you want to contribute to the project.

Additional required tools for installing from source code:

- [git](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) v5.8.0 or later
- Python development library and headers for your system

To install Guild from source, clone the repository by running:

``` command
git clone https://github.com/guildai/guildai.git
```

Change to the `guild` directory and install the required pip packages:

``` command
cd guildai
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Build Guild by running:

``` command
python setup.py build
```

Verify Guild by running:

``` command
guild/scripts/guild check
```

If see the message `NOT INSTALLED (No module named 'tensorflow')` that's okay - you'll install TensorFlow in the steps below. If you see other errors, [let us know](/new-topic?category=troubleshooting) and we'll help!

You can run the `GUILD_SOURCE_DIR/guild/scripts/guild` executable directly (where `GUILD_SOURCE_DIR` is the location of your cloned Guild AI source repository) or modify your environment to make `guild` available on your PATH using one of these methods:

- Add `GUILD_SOURCE_DIR/guild/scripts` directory to your `PATH` environment variable, OR
- Create a symlink to `GUILD_SOURCE_DIR/guild/scripts/guild` that is available on your PATH

## Command Completion

Guild AI supports command completion on bash, zsh, and fish shells. When configured correctly, this feature lets you press `Tab` when tying a command to show available completion options.

To install command completion for your shell, run:

``` command
guild completion --install
```

This command modifies your shell's init script to support Guild's command completion. Before Guild makes any changes, it creates a copy of your init script named `<file>.guild-backup.N` where `N` is an incrementing number.

Open a new terminal session to verify that command completion is supported. After opening a new terminal, type `guild` followed by a space and press `Tab`. If running bash, press `Tab` a second time. If completion is configured correctly you will see the list of available Guild commands.

## Install Optional Libraries

If you system has a GPU or other accelerator supported by TensorFlow, you will need to install and configure support for your hardware.

### CUDA and cuDNN

If you have an NVIDIA GPU and and want to use the GPU enabled TensorFlow package, you must install the NVIDIA CUDA and cuDNN libraries for your system. Refer to the links below for help installing the libraries.

- [CUDA Toolkit Download](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads)
- [NVIDIA cuDNN](https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn)

### NVIDIA System Management Interface

Guild uses NVIDIA System Management Interface (`nvidia-smi`) on GPU accelerated systems to collect GPU metrics. This tool is optional and Guild will run without it. However, to collect GPU stats on systems with one or more GPUs, ensure that `nvidia-smi` is installed.

> <span data-guild-class="callout note">Note</span> NVIDIA System Management Interface is typically installed with NVIDIA GPU drivers. Refer to [NVIDIA System Management Interface](https://developer.nvidia.com/nvidia-system-management-interface) for more information.

## Verify your Installation

Verify that Guild is installed properly by running [`guild check`](/commands/check):

``` command
guild check
```
If there are problems with your installation, Guild shows the details and exits with an error.

## Next Steps

Congratulations, you've installed Guild AI!
